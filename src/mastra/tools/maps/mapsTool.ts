  description: `A natural language Google Maps tool that delegates all operations to a specialized Maps agent. Simply describe what you want to do with Google Maps in plain English.

## HOW TO USE

Just describe your Google Maps task naturally! The tool accepts natural language requests and handles all the complexity for you.

### Examples of Requests:

**Finding Places:**
- "Find restaurants near Times Square"

- "Look for gas stations within 5 miles of my location"
- "Find the best Italian restaurants in Little Italy"

**Getting Directions:**
- "Get directions from JFK Airport to Manhattan"
- "How do I get from Mumbai to Pune by car?"
- "Give me walking directions to the nearest subway station"
- "Show me the route from my hotel to the conference center"

**Nearby Search:**
- "What's around me right now?"
- "Find ATMs near Marine Drive, Mumbai"
- "Show me all hospitals within 2 km of my location"
- "Find parking spots near the shopping mall"

**Location Information:**
- "What's the address of the Empire State Building?"
- "Convert these coordinates to an address: 40.7128, -74.0060"
- "Get my current location coordinates"
- "Where exactly is 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway?"

**Distance & Travel Time:**
- "How far is it from Los Angeles to San Francisco?"
- "Calculate travel time between these cities by train"
- "Compare driving vs walking time to the office"
- "How long does it take to get there by bicycle?"

**Complex Navigation:**
- "Plan a route from home to work with a stop at the grocery store"
- "Find the fastest route avoiding tolls"
- "Get public transit directions with the least walking"
- "Plan a multi-city road trip route"

## WHAT YOU CAN PROVIDE

While the tool works with natural language, you can also provide specific details when available:

- **Location names or addresses** for searches and directions
- **Travel modes** (driving, walking, transit, bicycling)
- **Search radius** for nearby searches
- **Place types** (restaurant, gas_station, hospital, etc.)
- **Coordinates** (latitude/longitude) for precise locations
- **Multiple locations** for route planning and distance calculations

## INTELLIGENCE FEATURES

The Google Maps specialist agent will:
- âœ… **Interpret your intent** from natural language
- âœ… **Find locations** when you describe them
- âœ… **Ask for missing information** when needed
- âœ… **Handle authentication** automatically
- âœ… **Use best practices** for location searches and navigation
- âœ… **Provide helpful responses** with addresses, coordinates, and travel details
- âœ… **Handle complex workflows** like multi-stop route planning
- âœ… **Optimize searches** for better results and performance

## BEST PRACTICES APPLIED

The agent automatically follows best practices:
- **Smart Location Discovery**: Finds places by description when exact addresses aren't provided
- **Optimal Route Planning**: Chooses appropriate travel modes and considers traffic
- **Efficient Searches**: Uses proper search radius and filters for relevant results
- **Privacy Protection**: Handles location data responsibly and securely
- **Performance Optimization**: Caches results and minimizes API calls

## LOCATION SERVICES

The agent can handle all Google Maps services:
- **Place Search**: Find businesses, landmarks, and points of interest
- **Navigation**: Turn-by-turn directions with multiple travel modes
- **Geocoding**: Convert between addresses and coordinates
- **Nearby Search**: Discover places around specific locations
- **Distance Matrix**: Calculate travel times and distances
- **Current Location**: Get device location when permitted

## SECURITY & PRIVACY

- All operations go through Google's secure APIs
- Authentication is handled safely
- Location data is processed securely and not stored unnecessarily
- Privacy best practices for location services are automatically applied
- User consent is respected for location-based requests`,
