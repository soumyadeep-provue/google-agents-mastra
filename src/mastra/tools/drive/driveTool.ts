  description: `A natural language Google Drive tool that delegates all operations to a specialized Drive agent. Simply describe what you want to do with Google Drive in plain English.

## HOW TO USE

Just describe your Google Drive task naturally! The tool accepts natural language requests and handles all the complexity for you.

### Examples of Requests:

**Finding Files & Folders:**
- "Find all my presentation files"
- "Search for documents containing 'budget'"
- "Show me all PDF files in my drive"
- "Look for the project proposal folder"

**Creating Folders:**
- "Create a folder called 'Client Documents 2024'"
- "Make a new folder for project files"
- "Create a subfolder called 'Images' in my Marketing folder"

**File Management:**
- "Upload the contract.pdf file to my Legal folder"
- "Move the quarterly report to the Reports folder"
- "Download my presentation file to the Desktop"
- "Copy the template document for the new project"

**Sharing & Collaboration:**
- "Share the budget spreadsheet with john@company.com with edit access"
- "Give read access to the project folder to the entire team"
- "Share my presentation with sarah@client.com as view-only"

**Organization:**
- "Organize all my photos into a Photos folder"
- "Move all documents from last month to the Archive folder"
- "Create a project structure with subfolders for docs, images, and data"

**Complex Operations:**
- "Find all unorganized files and suggest a folder structure"
- "Upload my local project files and organize them by type"
- "Share the entire project folder with the team and set appropriate permissions"

## WHAT YOU CAN PROVIDE

While the tool works with natural language, you can also provide specific details when available:

- **File names or descriptions** for searching
- **Folder names** for organization
- **File paths** for uploads and downloads
- **File/Folder IDs** when you know them
- **Email addresses** for sharing
- **Permission levels** (reader, writer, commenter)
- **MIME types** for specific file filtering

## INTELLIGENCE FEATURES

The Google Drive specialist agent will:
- âœ… **Interpret your intent** from natural language
- âœ… **Find files and folders** when you describe them
- âœ… **Ask for missing information** when needed
- âœ… **Handle authentication** automatically
- âœ… **Use best practices** for file organization and sharing
- âœ… **Provide helpful responses** about what was accomplished
- âœ… **Handle complex workflows** like multi-step file operations
- âœ… **Manage permissions** intelligently and securely

## BEST PRACTICES APPLIED

The agent automatically follows best practices:
- **Smart File Discovery**: Searches for files by name/type when IDs aren't provided
- **Secure Sharing**: Uses appropriate permission levels for different collaboration needs
- **Efficient Organization**: Creates logical folder structures and file hierarchies
- **Error Prevention**: Validates operations and provides clear feedback
- **Privacy Protection**: Handles sensitive file sharing with appropriate caution

## SECURITY & PRIVACY

- All operations go through Google's secure APIs
- Authentication is handled safely
- Your file data remains private and secure
- Best practices for file sharing and permissions are automatically applied
- Sensitive operations require explicit confirmation`,
